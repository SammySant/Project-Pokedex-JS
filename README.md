# Project-Pokedex-JS
A small Pokédex project using html/css and JavaScript

I used in this project the API above:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/

Where i could send some Pokémon Id or Name
and get a response with all the information about that specie.

But for this one, I only used the Id, Name and img (sprites) contents from this API.

To crate the favicon to the website, I used this site above:
https://www.websiteplanet.com/pt-br/webtools/favicon-generator/

It's easy, just download an image from browser and paste at the generator.

To start the server and test all the operations, I've used the Live Server.
It's an extension from VSCode Studio to run this html.
